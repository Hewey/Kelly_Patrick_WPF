//Calculate how old Sparky the pit bull is in dog years based on his actual age.

var sparkyAge = 1; //This a variable created using the given information of Sparky's age.
var humanAge= sparkyAge * 7; //This is a result variable using the sparkyAge variable multiplied by 7 to calculate Sparky's age in human years.
console.log("Sparky is " + humanAge + " human years old which is " + sparkyAge + " in dog years.") //This will print the results in the console. The console should print, "Sparky is 7 human years old which is 1 in dog years."

//Create an expression that calculates how much pizza each partygoer will get at the party.

var pizzaSlices = 8; //This is the variable representing the ammount of slices of pizza.
var partyPeople = 12; //This the variable for the ammount of people at the party. 
var pizzaNu = 2; //This is the variable for the ammount of pizzas at the party.
var SlicesPp = pizzaSlices * pizzaNu/partyPeople; //This is the results variable to calculate how many slices of pizza a partygoer gets.
console.log(SlicesPp);
